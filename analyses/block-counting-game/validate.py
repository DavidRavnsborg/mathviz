    Compute the total number of game state permutations.

    Parameters:
      c (int): number of colors.
      n (int): number of blocks per color.
      k (int): number of towers.
      h (int): maximum height of each tower.

    Returns:
      int: total number of game state permutations.

    The function first counts the number of ways to distribute
    the c*n blocks among k towers (each tower holding at most h blocks)
    using inclusion-exclusion. Then it multiplies by the number of ways
    to assign colors (with n copies per color) to the block positions.

    # For example, the case c=3, n=1, k=4, h=2:
    # Total blocks = 3. The distributions count (via inclusionâ€“exclusion) is computed as follows:
    #   For j = 0:
    #      term = comb(4,0) * comb(3 - 0*3 + 4 - 1, 3) = 1 * comb(6,3) = 20.
    #   For j = 1:
    #      term = - comb(4,1) * comb(3 - 1*3 + 4 - 1, 3) = -4 * comb(3,3) = -4.
    #   Sum of distributions = 20 - 4 = 16.
    #
    # The color assignments are 3! = 6 (since we have 3 distinct blocks).
    # Thus the total should be 16 * 6 = 96.
